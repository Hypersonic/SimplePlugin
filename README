            > Healing
            > Summoning defenses (think summoning a temporary cobblestone wall in front of you)
            > Offensive spells (think Ghast explosions)
            > Summon Mobs
        | Building spells
            > Summon walls or cuboids, using the materials in your inventory and some form of payment (magic points?).
        | Mining-related spells
            > Compass points to the nearest of a certain type of ore or maybe you get the coords?
        | Warps/teleportation in general.
            > Something like /j, /ascend, /descend and maybe something between worlds.
    - System like magic points or magic resources.
    - Some spells only work in certain worlds? or cost different amounts in different worlds?
